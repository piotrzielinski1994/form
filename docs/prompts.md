```
I added the most important folders to your context. `vehicle-data` is source and `ComplexForm` is destination to which you will generate code. I want you to get visibility and validation rules from `vehicle-data` and add them to relevant files in `ComplexForm` folder. List of source fields is in `as24-manual-listing-creation/src/modules/common/configuration/vehicle-data/fields.ts`. Destination validation file is `form/src/components/ComplexForm/schema.ts` and destination visibility file is `form/src/components/ComplexForm/visibility.ts`.
